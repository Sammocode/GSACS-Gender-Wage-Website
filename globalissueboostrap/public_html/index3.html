          <h2> A Persistent Issue</h2>
          <p>Ever since women have joined the workforce overtime they have been severely underpaid. Women get paid 80-87 cents for every whole dollar that a man earns depending where they live. Women get less pay because throughout history men would have to mainly do jobs. Overtime as women join the work force in the same career as men they are not considered for how they impact the workforce even though they can earn college degrees and certifications to help them overtime with their career. Even with women getting high standards of education then don't earn the same rate as men do.. The International Labor Organization talks about how women tend to have higher staff work environment in Palestine. In 2016 it recorded that through the private, public and school work sector 60% work throughout Palestine compared to men's 40%. Even with more women working in the 3 sectors men still got paid more. </p>

          <h3> Pay Gap Overtime</h3>
          <p>Since the early 1900s women have been paid less than men have. Before in most times women would have to do work at home like care for their house and family as well. Overtime as women have joined the work force and gone to school over the years they get underpaid because they still consider men to have to work the most. Now in modern day times it is still an issue. Economist believe that women and men wont have the pay gap anymore around 2060-2070 if society makes these changes in the future. In a controlled environment women should be allowed to have equal pay no matter what career or position it is. Equal pay can also make sure that women are able to make the same as a man. Equal pay would cause less issues at the work environment knowing that they can make the same amount as their co worker and not regarding gender as well.</p></div></div>
