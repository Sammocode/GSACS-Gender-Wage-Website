      <p>Women are paid <em> 79 cents </em>for every dollar paid to men—despite the fact that over the last several decades millions more women have joined the workforce and made huge gains in their educational attainment. Too often it is assumed that this pay gap is not evidence of discrimination, but is instead a statistical artifact of failing to adjust for factors that could drive earnings differences between men and women.</p>
      <p>However, these factors—particularly occupational differences between women and men—are themselves often affected by gender bias. For example, by the time a woman earns her first dollar, her occupational choice is the culmination of years of education, guidance by mentors, expectations set by those who raised her, hiring practices of firms, and widespread norms and expectations about work–family balance held by employers, co-workers, and society. In other words, even though women disproportionately enter lower-paid, female-dominated occupations, this decision is shaped by discrimination, societal norms, and other forces beyond women’s control.</p>
      <p>On average, women employed in the United States lose a combined total of nearly $1.6 trillion every year due to the wage gap. These lost wages mean women and their families have less money to support themselves, care for their families and communities, and save and invest for the future. Families, businesses and the economy suffer as a result.</p>
      <p>It should be noted that the wage here includes the basic salary or cash wage, the family allowance, the cost-of-living allowance, the certificate premium, the educational level, and any bonuses for the profession. The wages of workers in the private sector in Palestine will also be covered in this part. Workers in the public sector will be excluded because all public sectors are subject to the Palestinian Civil Service Law. Therefore, there is no gap in the wage gender gap for this sector.</p>

    <h3 class="container p-3 my-3">Why the gap persists instead of disappearing</h3>
    <p class="container p-3 my-3"> The persistence of a gap over the past 20 years, even when comparing apples to apples, suggests there are other factors at play. These can include potential discrimination. When Pew asked Americans in October what factors they believed played a role in the gender wage gap, half indicated a major reason is that employers treat women differently. Women were much more likely than men (61% vs 37%) to cite this as a major reason. Another factor that may help explain the stickiness of the pay gap is that the wage premium for those with college degrees has grown smaller. So while more employed women (48%) now have at least a bachelor’s degree than men (41%), it is worth less. </p>
    <p class="container p-3 my-3"> Individual choices such as taking periods away from the workforce to care for children also continue to play a role. Those choices may be borne of cultural norms, societal issues such as a lack of affordable child care, or personal preference Narrowing the gender pay gap from here may be tough sledding.</p>
    <p class="container p-3 my-3"> Pew researchers suggested:</p>
    <blockquote class="container" cite="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2023/03/01/the-enduring-grip-of-the-gender-pay-gap/"> “More sustained progress in closing the pay gap may depend on deeper changes in societal and cultural norms and in workplace flexibility that affect how men and women balance their careers and family lives,” </blockquote>

    <h3 class="container p-3"> Work Biasness Between Gender</h3>
    <h4 class="container p-3"> In terms of respresenation rate in other countries</h4>
    <p> Women are also underrepresented in the Palestinian work force, according to the Palestinian PCBS report. The female Palestinian participation rate in the labor force was 19.3%, while the male participation rate was 71.6%. The female participation rate, however, has nearly doubled in the past 15 years, from 10.3% in 2001, to 19.3% in 2016.</p>
    <p><u><b> In Education:</b></u> A 2016 report by the International Labor Organization found that the wage gap among Palestinians decreased with university education attainment, from nearly 50% with just a high-school education, down to 13% with a bachelor’s or master’s degree. However, educated Palestinian women are facing high unemployment. In 2015, according to the PCBS, women with 13 years of education had a 48% unemployment rate. The general unemployment rate in 2015 was 39.2% among women, and 22.5% among men.</p>
    <p><u><b> In Employment Rate:</b></u> Unemployed women are younger than employed women, and on average, they have more schooling. For example, in 2001 employed rural females had an average of 5 years of schooling less than their unemployed counterparts.  Unemployed men, on the other hand, are younger but they are less educated than employed men. This is manifested in the ratio of male/female unemployment rate which was 3.5 in 2001, but 1.4 in 1999 for rural areas. Since most of Palestinian who worked in Israel came from villages and had fewer years of education, the wage gap is mostly attributable to mobility restrictions between Israel and the Palestinian labor markets. Female participation rates dropped the most in rural areas (2.8 percentage points between the two years) where the employed/unemployed schooling gap is the largest.
