          <p> Regardless of the academic level each man and woman has when applying for a job, society is always dominated by gender norms. For example, a man should be paid more than a woman, implying that education doesn't really matter when it comes to compensation for workers. Due to their gender, a man and woman cannot both hold high-level educational paid positions. The compensation and advantages that a male employee receives over a female employee will never change. Similar to degrees from universities, even if a woman lands a high-paying career, men won't have the same obstacles as she does in the workplace because of variations in gender.</p>

          <p>Women's rights have made some progress on a worldwide level. 13.4% of women in the State of Palestine who were previously married or in a relationship and were now between the ages of 20 and 24 were under the age of 18. The adolescent birth rate dropped to 43 per 1,000 women aged 15 to 19 in 2018 from 48 per 1,000 in that year. In 2020, 61% of fertile women between the ages of 15 and 49 had their family planning requirements met.</p>

          <p>More work has to be done in order to achieve gender equality in the State of Palestine. With a focus on violence against women, the SDG indicator shows that 41.7% of legal frameworks that support, uphold, and monitor gender equality are in place. 19.1% of women between the ages of 15 and 49 reported being physically or sexually abused by a current or former intimate partner in the previous year. Women and girls aged 15 and older devote 20.1% of their time to unpaid caregiving and domestic responsibilities, compared to 3% for men.</p>

          <h3>Objectives</h3>
          <p>Project objectives will be realized through a set of outputs focusing on pay equity,violence-free workplace as well as exploration of care infrastructure and provisions. Moreover, cooperatives will be strengthened both as a part of the delivery of other areas of work such as care provisioning and as a standalone effort.</p>
          <div>
            <p>Accordingly, the project aims to:</p>

            <p>Promote non-discrimination in the workforce, Enhance women's economic empowerment through innovative cooperatives,Improve the capacity of national institutions to address structural barriers impeding female labor force participation,Create more jobs of higher quality at the grassroots and community levels by strengthening viable member controlled cooperatives to work as social and economic enterprises.</p>

              <p>In the occupied Palestinian area, there has been a sizable and ongoing gender difference in labor force participation during the previous 10 years. While the rate of males entering the work market has increased from 13 percent in 2000 to 16 percent in June 2013, the rate of women entering the labor force has stayed at less than a quarter of the rate of men since 2000.</p>
              <p>Additionally, there is still a sizable gender wage disparity in the Palestinian area. Only 84% of men's daily median wages go to women. In the manufacturing industry, where women are paid just 57% of men's median wages, the wage disparity is considerably larger. The gender pay disparity among new graduates in their first private sector employment, which is 20 percent, reflects the pervasiveness and durability of wage discrimination against women. There has also begun to be a rise in gender-based violence in the workplace. According to a recent ILO poll, about 23% of women had been the victim of assault.</p>
