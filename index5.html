    <h3>Raise Awareness Regarding Gender Equality</h3>
    <p>
      Increasing awareness is key to confronting entrenched social norms and attitudes about gender roles. The Ministry of Women’s Affairs and MoL can cooperate with civil society organizations, business women’s associations, and international institutions such as UN Women. Together, they can organize public awareness campaigns and introduce capacity-building initiatives to promote gender equality and encourage a more gender-balanced redistribution of the responsibility of unpaid care work. Awareness-raising should also target younger generations, introducing gender equality in curricula at various educational levels. These efforts can capitalize on positive attitudes that have recently surfaced in Palestinian society. Greater awareness-raising could further sway men towards gender equality.
    </p>

    <h3>Redistribute the Responsibility for Unpaid Care Work</h3>
    <p>
      Reducing the time that women spend on unpaid care is vital to expand their opportunities to enter the labour market. The Government should mobilize resources to enforce the newly ratified education law to make kindergarten education universal. Since the market has failed to expand nursery services, the Government should intervene to establish more public nurseries or provide financial incentives to the private sector and NGOs to deliver these services. Given fiscal challenges, different provision models and financing options should be explored.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ultimately, redistributing the responsibility of unpaid care work between women and men is key. Paternity leave is commonly used in several countries. While it might be ineffective in Palestine in the short term due to deeply rooted gendered divisions of labour, it could be effective in the long run if coupled with awareness-raising on gender equality.

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The Palestinian Government has made positive strides in elevating gender equality and women’s rights. Formal commitments to international frameworks, national strategies, and statistical data gathering exist. While much of it remains symbolic, it creates space for practical initiatives. However, impact on the status of Palestinian women remains limited. Reports and interviews indicate systemic structural obstacles to realizing civil and human rights.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          MoWA, in partnership with women’s civil society organizations, has played a critical role in bringing gender equality, women’s empowerment, and social justice to the forefront of the government’s agenda—including pushing through new and adapted policies.

    <h3>Support Fair Scheduling Practices</h3>
    <p>
      Women—especially women of color—are more likely to work in low-wage jobs with rigid, unpredictable schedules. This makes it difficult for working parents, especially mothers, to arrange child care. Legislation in Vermont and San Francisco provides a “right to request,” allowing workers to ask for flexibility or predictability without risking their jobs. Keeping a job is essential to closing the gender pay gap.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="container p-3">
    <h3>Support Pay Transparency</h3>
    <p>
      When women cannot discuss their salaries, they often don’t know they’re being paid less than male colleagues for the same work. The Paycheck Fairness Act would reduce pay secrecy, give women tools to address discrimination, and make it harder for companies to justify unequal pay.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="container p-3">
    <h3>Society Results</h3>
    <p>
      The gender wage gap is real—and it hurts women across the board. It’s often dismissed as a statistical artifact, but occupational differences are shaped by gender bias. Serious efforts to understand the gap must avoid blaming women and instead examine how the economy provides unequal opportunities at every stage of education, training, and career development.
